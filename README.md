## What

Clojarr is a hard fork of Clojure. Rich Hickey wrote Clojure to be the
language he wanted, and administers it in the way that he wants. This is
awesome, but I (Reid McKenzie) disagree with enough of the choices made in the
language and its administration that I've forked to go my own way.

The name itself is a corruption of "Clojure" which I owe to Gregory
Cerna.

## Goals

Clojarr is in no small part an experiment in what Clojure would look
like if it had a different contribution process, and was more willing
to make bold/risky changes.

Unlike Clojure which is eminently stable, Clojarr is not guaranteed to be
stable (yet). Some level of breaking changes with Clojure will
be accepted if there is a good reason for them.

## Administration

Currently, Clojarr is administered at my (Reid McKenzie's) sole
discretion. Pull requests, issues and email are all considered requests for
work/support and will only be adressed when and if it suits me to address them
or an explicit support contract has been issued.

This is not to say that contributions, bug reports, and feature requests are
not welcome, only to clearly state my expectations for the project and its
management.
